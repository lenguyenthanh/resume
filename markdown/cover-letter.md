Dear Hiring Manager!

As someone who is highly focused and attentive to detail, I thrive on building quality systems and solving difficult problems. That why I am really excited to be applying for the Software Engineer position at Recorded Future.


In my role at The Techno Creatives, I introduce functional programming techniques as well as many other best practices to my teams across multiple projects. I was chosen to develop [Beckon-Android](https://github.com/technocreatives/beckon-android) library which is a difficult and important project for our company. Since the last two years, I have become more versatile by working on multiple disciplines and with different programming languages such as Rust, typescript, Swift. In my current project - [Tyri IntelliLight](https://www.tyrilights.com/intellilight/) - I work on Backend, and make architecture decisions for Android and some parts of IOS apps.

Even though I do not use Scala in my job, but I love Scala and use it in most of my recent open source works. Which includes [Lichess.org](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila) - the second largest chess server in the world. So I believe with my experience with JVM ecosystem and my passionate with Scala, I am confident that I can learn and become productive quickly at the Recorded Future Platform team.

Recorded Future team would benefit from my following attributes:

- Passionate about functional programming and Scala
- Ability to learn and adapt quickly to new projects, environments
- Ability to work in different languages and frameworks

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to sharing more details of my experience and motivations with you.
Please let me know if you need additional information or materials from me.


Best Regards,


Thanh Le
