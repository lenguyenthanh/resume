I use many libraries from [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) ecosystem to our Kotlin projects which includes [Beckon-Android](https://github.com/technocreatives/beckon-android) where I am the main developer. Since the last two years, I became more versatile by working on multiple disciplines and with different programming languages such as Rust, typescript, Swift. In my current project - [Tyri IntelliLight](https://www.tyrilights.com/intellilight/) - I work on backend, and make architecture decisions for Android and some part of IOS app.

Beside my day works, I like to spend my time on learning about functional programming and contributing to open source softwares.

My value quickly became apparent to our company, so I've been transisted to more backend, architecture position. Now I work on backend and take part of architecture decision on
