Dear Hiring Manager!

I am excited to be applying for the Software Engineer position at Neo4j Cypher team, not only because of my interest in interpreter/compilers but also because I've been an a

In my role at The Techno Creatives, I introduce functional programming techniques to my teams across multiple projects. I use many libraries from the [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) ecosystem to our Kotlin projects which includes [Beckon-Android](https://github.com/technocreatives/beckon-android) where I am the main developer. Since the last two years, I have become more versatile by working on multiple disciplines and with different programming languages such as Rust, typescript, Swift. In my current project - [Tyri IntelliLight](https://www.tyrilights.com/intellilight/) - I work on Backend, and make architecture decisions for Android and some parts of IOS apps.

So even though I do not have any professional experience in Haskell, I am confident that I can learn and become productive quickly at Scrive's Platform team.

Neo4j and especially Cypher team would benefit from my following attributes:

- Passionate about functional programming
- Passionate about interpreters, compilers, type theory
- Ability to learn and adapt quickly to new projects, environments
- Ability to work in different languages and frameworks
- Ability to read academic papers and solve difficult problems

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to sharing more details of my experience and motivations with you.
Please let me know if you need additional information or materials from me.


Best Regards,


Thanh Le
