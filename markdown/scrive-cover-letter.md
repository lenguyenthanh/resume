Dear Hiring Manager!

I am excited to be applying for the Haskell Developer position at Scrive, not only because it is a Haskell Developer position, but also because I have been impressed by the convenience of Scrive's product. I am a functional programming enthusiast, so a Haskell job is always a dream of mine.

In my role at The Techno Creatives, I introduce functional programming techniques to my teams across multiple projects. I use many libraries from the [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) ecosystem to our Kotlin projects which includes [Beckon-Android](https://github.com/technocreatives/beckon-android) where I am the main developer. Since the last two years, I have become more versatile by working on multiple disciplines and with different programming languages such as Rust, typescript, Swift. In my current project - [Tyri IntelliLight](https://www.tyrilights.com/intellilight/) - I work on Backend, and make architecture decisions for Android and some parts of IOS apps.

In my free time, I like to spend my time on learning about functional programming, category theory and contributing to open source software (mostly related to functional programming). Haskell is one of my favorite languages. I learned it 4 years ago but I haven't had any opportunity to use it in a professional context. I am able to read/write basic Haskell code. Here are some example Haskell code that I wrote:

* [hh](https://github.com/lenguyenthanh/hh): A command line tool to manage multiple repositories in Github which uses:

  - [ReaderT pattern](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern/)
  - Tagless Final Style

* [Monad Transformers Step by Step](https://github.com/lenguyenthanh/Monad-Transformers-Step-by-Step): Code follow along when reading [Monad Transformers Step by Step](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.71.596&rep=rep1&type=pdf) paper.

So even though I do not have any professional experience in Haskell, I am confident that I can learn and become productive quickly at Scrive's Platform team.

Scrive would benefit from my following attributes:

- Passionate about functional programming
- Experience with remote work
- Ability to learn and adapt quickly to new projects, environments
- Ability to work in different languages and frameworks
- Ability to read academic papers and solve difficult problems

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to sharing more details of my experience and motivations with you.
Please let me know if you need additional information or materials from me.


Best Regards,


Thanh Le
